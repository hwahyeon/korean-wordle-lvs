        This is the start screen. Since there are no clues yet, why not try any
        word? Let's try <span>하늘</span>.

        As the tile colors change, we get several clues.
        <br /> Today's word does not include <span>ㅎ</span>,<span>ㄴ</span>,
        <span>ㅡ</span>,<span>ㄹ</span>, but it does include <span>ㅏ</span>.{" "}

        Oh, it's not the correct answer, but we've got a definite clue. Today's
        word ends with <span>사</span>. <br />
        Hmm, shall we try <span>경사</span>?

        Amazing luck!

        You got it right on the first try!

        Hey, could you share <br />
        the lottery numbers with me?😏

        Fantastic! You succeeded in just two tries!

        Incredible! Got it in three tries.

        You succeeded on the fifth try.

        You don’t seem too relaxed...

        Didn’t feel tense, you say? Really?🤨
